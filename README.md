# Minesweeper

I decided to make this game whilst mentoring students that are currently enrolled in the Software engineering immersive course at General Assembly.

I was mentoring students around the time of their project 1 week and I decided to take a few of the project briefs and have a crack at them myself.

The recursive functions for finding and filling in the blanks was a bit of a headache, but after a few infinite loops and inevitible browser crashes I got there in the end.

It's only a basic show of the game.

I'll add difficulties in the future but for now the grid size is only changeable by modifying the width variable to change the board size, and mineCount to change the ammount of mines on the board.

I didn't really have time to do any styling, so if you want to go ahead and do it, send me a PR.
